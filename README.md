The dataset includes 2342 images. Spinal-canal-stenosis are annotated in Tensorflow TFRecord (raccoon) format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:

- 50% probability of horizontal flip
  
The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:

- Randomly crop between 0 and 43 percent of the bounding box Format: TensorFlow (TFRecords) Contains: Annotated lumbar spine images with labeled degenerative conditions. ðŸ“Š Results The model achieves high accuracy in classifying lumbar spine conditions. Uses real-time object detection for medical imaging. Supports bounding box annotations for better interpretability. ðŸš€ Future Improvements Enhance model performance with hyperparameter tuning. Expand the dataset for better generalization. Implement Grad-CAM for explainability in medical AI.
